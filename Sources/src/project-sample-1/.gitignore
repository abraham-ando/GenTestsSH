├── src/                    # Source files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)
│   ├── index.html         # Login page
│   └── dashboard.html     # Dashboard page
├── tests/                  # Test files

├── pytest.ini             # Pytest configuration
└── README.md              # This file
```

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests from project root
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with auto-heal framework
auto-heal test-project .

# Run specific test
pytest tests/playwright/test_project_sample_1.py -v
```

## Features Tested

- Login page functionality
- Dashboard navigation
- Form validation
- Auto-healing capabilities

## Development

Add your HTML/web files in `src/` and your Playwright tests in `tests/playwright/`.

The framework will automatically:
- Detect test failures
- Analyze the issue using LLM
- Propose fixes
- Apply patches with confidence scoring
